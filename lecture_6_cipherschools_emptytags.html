    Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, 
    <br>
    And sorry I could not travel both
    <br> 
    And be one traveler, long I stood
    <br> 
    And looked down one as far as I could 
    <br>
    To wwhere it bent in the undergrowth;
    <br>
    <br>
    Then took other, as just as fair,
    <br>
    And having perhaps the better claim, 
    <br>
    because it was grassy and wanted wear;
    <br>
    Through as for that the passing there 
    <br>
    Had worn them really about the same,
    <br>

        And both that morning equally lay
        <br>
        In leaves no step had trodden black.

    'The starlight Night' was
        one of two poems which Hoplins
        sent to his mother as a birthday present,

    the other poem being 'God's Grandeur'. 
            What a birthday present!</pre>
